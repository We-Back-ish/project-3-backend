They say that there’s history on every block, but sometimes you come across a stretch of road where the strange stories seem to come up through every crack. One such place is the stretch of Taylor St. between Halsted and Ashland. Known today as Little Italy, the prohibition era mobsters were only one link in a long chain of fascinating stories. On this in-person walking minute tour, author and historian Adam Selzer will tell stories of arsonist queens, public hangings, miser’s curses, devil baby scares, nuns whose bodies turned to stone, and legendary mobsters of the 1920s who made Taylor Street their home.",
